This was my final project for CS51: Introduction to Computer Programming II, which I took last spring. The code here runs an interpreter for a subset of the functional programming language OCaml.  Other than the lexer, parser, and the file called miniml.ml,  which were given as distribution code to everyone in the class, I wrote the rest of the code here.
