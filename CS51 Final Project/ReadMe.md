This was my final project for CS51: Introduction to Computer Programming II, which I took last spring. The code here runs an interpreter for a subset of the functional programming language OCaml - all the basic operations, types, and data structures can be used in this implementation on Miniml. The interpreter can also handle functions, composition of functions, and recursion. However, this interpreter does not handle Object Oriented Programming or Lazy Programming.  

Other than the lexer, parser, and the file called miniml.ml,  which were given as distribution code to everyone in the class, I wrote the rest of the code here.
