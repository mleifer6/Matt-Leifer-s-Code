Here's a sample of the code I produced this summer to analyze millions of crowdsourced answers collected by Google. The total project was a couple thousand lines in total, all of which I wrote.

Sample 1 has a some functions that will parse the data files Google gave to me and Sample 2 will output some graphs and other statistics once the data is analyzed.  The functions and code that control the actual analysis I unfortunately can’t include here.

I wrote this code last summer while working in the laboratory of Dr. David Parkes, George F. Colony Professor of Computer Science at Harvard as a PRISE (Program for Research in Science and Engineering) Fellow.  My research focused on systems for maximizing the truthfulness and accuracy of crowd-sourced information.  In particular, we developed methods for providing respondents with improved incentives to answer questions honestly and correctly.  Commonly used systems suffer from a variety of shortcomings – many can be easily manipulated by their users and often require unrealistic assumptions to work properly.  Through a collaboration with Google that gave us access to data from thousands of crowd-sourced questions, I was able to test the system I developed, identify the problems in other systems, and confirm that my system was free of any such problems and determined therefore that it would be the best system for Google to implement.
