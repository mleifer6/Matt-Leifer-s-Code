Here's a sample of the code I produced this summer to analyze millions of crowdsourced answers collected by Google - it represents about a third of code produced for this project. 

Sample 1 has a some functions that will parse the data files Google gave to me and Sample 2 will output some graphs and other statistics once the data is analyzed.  The functions and code that control the analysis are not included here.
