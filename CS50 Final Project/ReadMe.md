This is the code for a website called Health+, which I made for my Final Project in the class CS50: Introduction to Computer Programming I, which I took Fall 2015.  The website allowed users to look up the calorie counts and nutritional info for foods the wanted to eat and then record the food they ate and the amount in a food log.
